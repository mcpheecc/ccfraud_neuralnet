# ccfraud_neuralnet
Neural Network trained to detect fraudulent transactions. Written in Python.

Uses TensorFlow library to create a Neural Network. Dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud. Relevant customer identifaction data was anonymized using PCA Dimension Reduction (as V1-V28) to protect confidentiality. Dataset is very skewed (492 instances of fraud out of 284807 transactions), but the dataset is a good learning tool for real world models.
